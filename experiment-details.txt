Experiment:

1) By mistake u code in master.
    Condition: Clone branch and start doing changes in master branch

    Solutin:
        git status
        git checkout -b p2 [ this will create branch and also checkout in that branch ]
        git add .
        git commit -m "basic inital changes" 
        git checkout master 
        git status 

    Conclusion: master is clean now.

2) 
        git add .

        [ If you do any changes after this cmd then you have to again add changes ]

        git add .

3) Working on two branch
    Condtion: If you working on one branch but due to requirment missing you block.
                And you have also sencond working.

    Solution: 
            Commit changes in one branch 
            checkout changes in second branch
            After changes commit in this branch 
            Checkout in previous branch
            In this way you can simultaneoulsy work on two branch

4) Renaming branch

        git branch -m <old-branch-name> <new-branch-name>

        git branch -m p2 experiment
