Experiment:

1) By mistake u code in master.
    Condition: Clone branch and start doing changes in master branch

    Solutin:
        git status
        git checkout -b p2 [ this will create branch and also checkout in that branch ]
        git add .
        git commit -m "basic inital changes" 
        git checkout master 
        git status 

    Conclusion: master is clean now.

2) 
        git add .

        [ If you do any changes after this cmd then you have to again add changes ]

        git add .
